## Subjects worth keeping in mind

You do not need all of computer science to write Python, but a few subjects
keep turning up for the rest of your career in IT — in interviews, in design
discussions, and on the day something is slow and nobody knows why. These are
the four worth going back to.

| Subject | Main core concepts |
| --- | --- |
| **Computer Organization and Architecture (COA)** | CPU, ALU, registers, Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), number systems, memory hierarchy, cache memory, pipelining, input/output organisation, assembly language |
| **Operating Systems (OS)** | Processes, threads, CPU scheduling, process synchronisation, deadlocks, memory management, virtual memory, file systems, system calls, operating system architecture |
| **Computer Networks (CN)** | OSI model, TCP/IP model, IP addressing, routing, switching, DNS, HTTP/HTTPS, TCP, UDP, network security |
| **Database Management Systems (DBMS)** | Database design, ER model, relational model, SQL, normalisation, transactions, ACID properties, indexing, joins, concurrency control, recovery |

## What is Programming?

Programming is the process of giving instructions to a computer to solve a problem.

## Programming Languages
- Low-level
- High-level

Examples: C, C++, Java, Python, JavaScript

## Compiled vs Interpreted

Compiled: C, C++, Go

Interpreted: Python, JavaScript

Python compiles to bytecode and runs on the Python Virtual Machine (PVM).

## Python Execution Flow

Python Code (.py) → Bytecode (.pyc) → Python Virtual Machine → Output

- python -m py_compile tyu.py
- find . -name "tyu*.pyc"

For a Python virtual environment (`.venv`), the main folders are:

| Folder/File    | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **bin/**       | Contains the executables for the virtual environment, such as `python`, `pip`, `jupyter`, and the activation scripts (`activate`, `Activate.ps1`). This is the folder you use most often.                      |
| **lib/**       | Stores the installed Python packages (`site-packages`) and the Python standard library files used by the virtual environment.                                                                                  |
| **include/**   | Contains C/C++ header files needed when compiling Python extensions or native modules. Usually empty unless building packages with C extensions.                                                               |
| **etc/**       | Stores configuration files for some installed tools. For example, Jupyter configuration may be placed here.                                                                                                    |
| **share/**     | Contains shared resources such as documentation, icons, schemas, templates, localization files, and Jupyter assets.                                                                                            |
| **lib64/**     | On 64-bit Linux, this usually points to `lib/` (often as a symbolic link). It exists for compatibility with software expecting a `lib64` directory.                                                            |
| **pyvenv.cfg** | The configuration file for the virtual environment. It records information such as the base Python installation, whether system packages are available, and the Python version used to create the environment. |

Inside **`bin/`**, you'll commonly see:

| File            | Purpose                                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `python`        | Python interpreter for this virtual environment.        |
| `pip`           | Installs and manages Python packages.                   |
| `activate`      | Activates the virtual environment in Bash/Zsh.          |
| `Activate.ps1`  | Activates the virtual environment in PowerShell.        |
| `activate.fish` | Activation script for the Fish shell.                   |
| `activate.csh`  | Activation script for C Shell (`csh`/`tcsh`).           |
| `jupyter`       | Starts Jupyter.                                         |
| `jupyter-lab`   | Starts JupyterLab.                                      |
| `ipython`       | Starts the enhanced interactive Python shell (IPython). |

A simple way to explain it to students is:

```text
.venv/
├── bin/          → Programs & commands
├── lib/          → Installed Python libraries
├── include/      → C/C++ header files
├── etc/          → Configuration files
├── share/        → Shared resources
├── lib64/        → 64-bit library link
└── pyvenv.cfg    → Virtual environment configuration
```

This mental model is usually enough for beginners.

| Command                 | Purpose                             |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `pwd`                   | Show the current working directory. |
| `ls`                    | List all files and folders.         |
| `cd folder_name`        | Change to another directory.        |
| `mkdir folder_name`     | Create a new folder.                |
| `touch file.py`         | Create an empty file (Linux/macOS). |
| `cp source destination` | Copy a file or folder.              |
| `mv old_name new_name`  | Move or rename a file/folder.       |
| `rm file.py`            | Delete a file.                      |
| `clear`                 | Clear the terminal screen.          |
| `history`               | Show previously executed commands.  |

Use these steps for **Windows**.

---

## Step 1: Download Python

* Open your browser.
* Go to **[https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)**
* Click **Download Python 3.x.x**.

---

## Step 2: Run the Installer

Double-click the downloaded `.exe` file.

### Very Important

Before clicking **Install Now**, check:

✅ **Add Python to PATH**

This allows you to run Python from Command Prompt.

Then click:

**Install Now**

Wait until installation completes.

---

## Step 3: Verify Installation

Open **Command Prompt** (`Win + R` → `cmd`).

Run:

```cmd
python --version
```

Example:

```text
Python 3.14.0
```

Also verify `pip`:

```cmd
pip --version
```

Example:

```text
pip 25.x.x
```

---

## Step 4: Create a Project Folder

```cmd
mkdir PythonCourse
cd PythonCourse
```

---

## Step 5: Create a Virtual Environment

```cmd
python -m venv .venv
```

You should now see:

```text
PythonCourse
│
├── .venv
```

---

## Step 6: Activate the Virtual Environment

### Command Prompt

```cmd
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### PowerShell

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

If successful, you'll see:

```text
(.venv) C:\Users\YourName\PythonCourse>
```

---

## Step 7: Upgrade pip

```cmd
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

---

## Step 8: Install Jupyter

```cmd
pip install jupyterlab notebook ipykernel
```

---

## Step 9: Register the Environment

```cmd
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=.venv --display-name="Python (.venv)"
```

---

## Step 10: Start JupyterLab

```cmd
jupyter lab
```

Your browser will automatically open JupyterLab.

---

## Step 11: Create Your First Notebook

* Click **Python (.venv)**.
* Rename the notebook.
* Start writing Python code.

---

## Step 12: Close Everything

Stop Jupyter:

Press:

```text
Ctrl + C
```

Then deactivate the virtual environment:

```cmd
deactivate
```

---

### Folder Structure

```text
PythonCourse/
│
├── .venv/
│   ├── Scripts/
│   ├── Lib/
│   ├── Include/
│   └── pyvenv.cfg
│
└── your_file.py
```

This workflow is the standard setup used for Python development on Windows.

## Useful Jupyter Shortcuts
- Shift+Enter : Run Cell
- Tab : Auto Complete
- Shift+Tab : Function Signature
- function? : Documentation
- function?? : Source (if available)

```python
print('Hello, World!')
```

## Understanding Functions
For every function ask:
1. Input?
2. Logic?
3. Output?

```python
name='Python'
print(len(name))
print(type(len(name)))
```

## Homework
- Install Python
- Install Jupyter
- Create a virtual environment
- Run your first notebook
- Practice print(), len(), type()
